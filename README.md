## REG NO:212224220120
## AIM:
To perform a heuristic evaluation of 2–3 competing apps/websites, identify usability issues, suggest improvements, and measure the impact of design changes using A/B testing.
## PROCEDURE:
Select 2–3 competing apps/websites for comparison.

Conduct heuristic evaluation based on usability principles (e.g., Nielsen’s heuristics).

Identify and document UX problems and suggest design improvements.

Implement required changes or prototypes for the apps/websites.

Perform A/B testing to compare original and modified versions.

Analyze user behavior and feedback to evaluate effectiveness of changes.

## RESULT:
Identified key usability issues and areas for improvement across competing apps.

Proposed and incorporated design changes to enhance user experience.

A/B testing showed improved user engagement and satisfaction with updated designs.

Demonstrated how heuristic evaluation and iterative design positively impact UX
